        NEW: ",F6F0E0"
      Upgraders can achieve the same by running this script:
        interfacecolors(",F6F0E0", 2);        
    ! Hover Box: Under certain conditions, the icon in the status area could fail to be 
      retrieved (instead, the question mark icon was shown) when a junction was in the 
      path. Fixed.
    ! SC gettoken: The combination of a delimiter longer than one character, a negative 
      index, and the flag "Return from start" could result in wrong returns. Fixed.

      (showed the question mark icon instead) for items that contained Unicode characters 
      in the name AND had a junction in the path (weird but true; must be a bug in one 
      Windows API; maybe only Win8.1, didn't check). Fixed.

      "Preserve all item dates" enabled, and "On name collision" set to "Suffix increment 
      to copy", the dates of the copy (the folder with the suffixed increment) were

    % Warning About Downgrading: In the past, when you shared the configuration between 
      the 32-bit and 64-bit versions, you would receive an unnecessary warning about

    + Configuration | General | Sort and Rename | Sort: Added option "Treat hyphens and 
      apostrophes like normal characters".
      Background: Unless it's a binary comparison, Windows's string comparison treats 
      hyphens and apostrophes in a special way that might not produce the desired sort 
      order. Now you are in control. For example:
        Not ticked:         Ticked:
          File.txt            File.txt
          File'A.txt          File'A.txt
          File-A.txt          File'C.txt
          FileB.txt           File-A.txt
          File'C.txt          File-C.txt
          File-C.txt          FileB.txt
      Remarks:
        - This setting only affects the Text and Natural sort methods.
        - And it only affects sorting in the main file list. Not in the folder tree and 
          not anywhere else.
        - Ticking this setting will slow down sorting a tiny bit, so if you don't need it, 
          don't tick it.
    ! Main Menu: Checkmarks in a submenu are not always updated when using the integrated 
      menu bar on the toolbar. Fixed.

      Examples:

    * SC filter: Removed the change from v27.90.0028 - 2025-08-16 20:45. Setting Visual

    + SC rename: New mode "ProperCase_NX". Same as "ProperCase" but without applying the

    ! Minimized to Tray: When the app is closed while minimized to the system tray and

      Adjusted the build stack reserve size from 1 MB to 8 MB, and it can now handle 80

      NOTE: If you upgrade to this beta, you have to manually assign the shortcuts via

      aren't many options left. You can easily change them to whatever you like.

        - And it only affects sorting in the main file list. Not in the folder tree and

    + Scripting got a new function (TB version only).
      Name: ApplyFolderView
      Action: Applies any of the saved folder views to the current list.
      Syntax: applyfolderview([path])
        path:   Path of the source folder view.
                If it does not look like a path it's checked for a partial match.
                If empty or missing then the default folder view is applied, if available.
        return: 0: No folder view found.
                1: Folder view found and successfully applied.
      Remarks:
        - You find a list of the available folder view here:
          View | Folder View Settings | Manage Folder Views...
        - You could create a small collection of folders in a corner of your AppData 
          folder, each with its own stored folder view. Then, you could use these folders 
          as a source for quickly applying a specific, complex style to the current list. 
          For example, you could use a custom toolbar button as a one-click solution for 
          this purpose.
      Examples:
        applyfolderview("E:\Test\FolderView2"); //matches exactly this path
        applyfolderview("Jimmy"); //matches the first folder view that contains "Jimmy" in the path
    + Floating Preview: Added toggle "Auto-Scroll to End" (Ctrl+E). Enable it to 
      automatically position the viewer at the end of a previewed text file. This can be 
      useful e.g. when viewing log files.
      The toggle is available in the context menu of the Floating Preview status bar 
      (which can be toggled by pressing S). The Ctrl+E keyboard shortcut is always 
      available (independently of the status bar and of the previewed file type), but of 
      course it only affects previewed texts.
      FYI, this raises tweak FPTextTail to the UI.

      text file. Currently implemented as a tweak:
        FPTextTail=1
    % Thumbnails: Experimentally implemented a little speed boost for non-cached 
      thumbnails. Exponentially more noticeable the more thumbnails there are.
    + New Constant: <cr> is resolved to the Carriage Return byte (0D).
    + New Constant: <lf> is resolved to the Line Feed byte (0A).
    > Constants <cr> and <lf> take an optional count parameter for repetition. Example:
        echo "Catch<lf 22>22";

    + Custom Copy | Collision Prompt: Now, differences between the source and target files 
      are marked in red. Previously, they were underlined.

      the contents are compared using SHA-384. If the contents differ, the size label 
      turns red and "Contents differ!" is added.
      Note: Due a TB bug (that will be fixed soon) some captions get bolder each time you 
      get the overwrite prompt.
    * XYcopy: Updated to 2.20.0004.

        |*.txt
    + Custom File Associations: You can now use the "$" symbol to represent the "Open" 
      command of the shell context menu. Files associated with "$" open with the Enter key 
      or by double-clicking, just as if they had been opened via the shell context menu.
      Background: In rare cases, subtle differences exist between the various ways Windows 
      offers to open a file. This new special character makes the "Open" command of the 
      shell context menu available in Custom File Associations.
      Examples:
        ini>$
        "Shell Open" ini>$
      In the first example the menu caption defaults to "Shell Context Menu > Open".
    + Added a tweak so that double-clicking on a single item in the list opens the item as 
      if it were opened from the shell context menu:
        DblClickToShellOpen=1
      Notes:
        - This is a quick, catch-all alternative to the more precise CFA "$" symbol above.
        - Any Custom File Associations are ignored with this setting.
        - Opening by pressing ENTER is not affected.
v27.90.0015 - 2025-07-30 12:23
    + Info Panel | Preview: You can now display the waveform of media files (audio and 
      video) in the progress bar if you have previously provided an image file containing 
      the waveform and named it according to the rules specified in a special template. 
      - Currently, the template is only available as a tweak (AudioPreviewWaveFormPath).
      - In addition to environment and XYplorer native variables the template supports two 
        special variables, <preview_base> and <preview_name> that are resolved to the base 
        (name without extension) or name (without path) of the currently previewed media file.
      - Below are two examples of how to define the template. The first is an absolute path 
        (<xydata> = XYplorer data folder), and the second is a subfolder (WaveForms) of the 
        folder containing the previewed media file:
          AudioPreviewWaveFormPath=<xydata>\WaveForms\<preview_base>.png
          AudioPreviewWaveFormPath=WaveForms\<preview_name>.png
      - Once the template is set, the media preview will display a matching image if one is 
        found. All standard image formats are supported.
      - The waveform image can have any size and is stretched as necessary to fill the 
        progress bar. The lower 3 pixels of the bar are reserved for the live progress 
        marker as it moves from beginning to end.
      - Note: XY cannot create waveforms on its own. You must prepare them with other software.
    * Info Panel | Preview | Media Progress Bar: Widened from 272 to 284 pixels (at 100% 
      screen scaling).
      FYI, the space for waveforms is exactly 284x15 pixels now (at 100% screen scaling), 
      so this is the size that won't suffer from stretching.
    ! Quick Search, SC quicksearch, Find Files: "size" selector comparisons returned 
      apparent rubbish when you passed byte units like KB or MB instead of raw bytes. Fixed.
        text quicksearch("size: < 1MB", "<xypath>", , n); //works as expected now

v27.90.0001 - 2025-07-10 15:18
    > The version number has been increased to 27.90.0001. Up to 9,998 revisions are 
      possible before the 64-bit version is officially released as v28.00.0000. That 
      should be sufficient.
      The space from v27.10.0000 to v27.80.9999 is reserved for updates, mostly bug fixes, 
      to the 32-bit version.
    ! SC base64encode: Didn't work. Fixed.
    ! TB Fix: VERSION info block 'FileVersion' string was padding the Revision part to 5 
      characters rather than 4 to match VBx.
    * XYcopy: Updated to 2.10.0278.

      is published in the beta channel of the user forum, in its own 64-bit beta thread.
    > The old 32-bit edition will not be discontinued entirely, but will receive bug fix 
      releases as necessary.
    + Help | About XYplorer: Now shows the twinBASIC version used to create it.

    Most users don't need to know this, but here are some points about the 64-bit 
    installation to keep you up-to-date:
    > The XY64 installer filename now begins with XYplorer64, for example:
      XYplorer64_27.00_Install.exe
    > The XY64 installer places the application into "C:\Program Files" now, not 
      "C:\Program Files (x86)" anymore.
    > The Help file is now called XYplorer64.chm.
    > To enable a smooth upgrade the 32-bit and 64-bit versions use same default app data 
      folder: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\XYplorer\ (aka %APPDATA%XYplorer\)
    > This means that if you use both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the app with the 
      default app data settings, they will share the same app data folder. This is 
      probably not a good idea unless you know what you're doing.
    > This also means that if you uninstall either version, 32-bit or 64-bit, using 
      Uninstall.exe (directly or via Shell "Programs and Features"), that shared app data 
      folder will be nuked.
v27.00.0905 - 2025-07-07 10:11
    + New Variable <xybitness>: Returns "32-bit" or "64-bit" depending on the bitness of 
      the main executable (XYplorer.exe).
        echo <xybitness>; //"32-bit" in the VB version, "64-bit" in the TB version        
    * Updated the help file.
